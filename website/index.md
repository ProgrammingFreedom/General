<h1 class="title-style">Welcome to the {{ site.content.project-name }} Project</h1>

This project is aimed at supporting the identification and implementation of tools and techniques to facilitate our long term survival as a species on this planet, taking into account such items as climate change, energy availability, and resource depletion as well as the human limitations that affect our recognition and desire to resolve our problems.  
We are always looking for people, definitely not necessarily technical, who feel that they can contribute
to the success of the project. All you need is ideas.If you want to help with the implementation of ideas,
there is plenty of things for you to do, but implementing ideas is not necessary. The basic fuel that drives the project is ideas and their formulation is vital. Ideas are a major contribution to us and we expect that most contributors will supply ideas only.
