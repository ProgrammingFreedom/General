This project is aimed at supporting the identification and implementation of tools and techniques to facilitate
our long term survival as a species on this planet, taking into account such items as climate change, energy
availability, and resource depletion as well as human limitations.
</p>
<p>We are always looking for people, definitely not necessarily technical, who feel that they can contribute
  to the success of the project. All you need is ideas.If you want to help with the implementation of ideas,
  there is plenty for you, but implementing ideas is not necessary. The basic fuel that drives the project is ideas and their formulation is vital.</p>
